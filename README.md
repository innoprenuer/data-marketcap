# Data-Marketcap
Data Tokens are data specific tokens which are built upon ocean protocol and ethereum.

Data Market Cap provides a fundamental analysis of the data tokens market such as price, metadata and marketcap. It aims to be an aggregrator for all the information about data tokens. Currently data tokens can only be bought and sold at balancer so the price and volume is derived from there. The website will keep updating itself as data tokens become more popular and are traded heavily on other DEXs and CEXs.
